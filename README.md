About PolyGomino
-------------------------
PolyGomino is a puzzle game inspired by Gomoku and Tetris. \
Player have 3 shapes of stones (similar-Polyomino), and Player has to place stones 5 or 6 in a row (or column or diagonal). \
A large number of Trans-Polyomino will emerge, and Player has to delete it.

Shapes will be complexier and harder as turn goes. \
If Player is not able to place any Trans-Polyomino on the board, game ends.
